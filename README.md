# mytest
This is a test repository that would I will be using to test Git and Github

This repository may not have any uses in the future, but for now it will be used as an empty repository that I will use for this problem set.

This line seen is the line I edited in by cloning my repository and editing it using the notepad on my machine. I was able to open this file by opening it through the terminal in RStudio. 

This line seen is what I used when I made the file open with RStudio instead. I do not know which application is the default for opening a file like this, but I am just experimenting by opening it with different text editing applications that could change the readme.md file.

One last note to add before I fully commit and push these changes back to the web. I am fascinated by the fact that you can edit these files through any text file, and using the terminal, you can edit what is on github.
